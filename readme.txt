Many themes allow you to add custom CSS. You can use this feature to customize the look of the widget.

If your theme doesn't offer custom CSS, you can try these plugins:

* [My Custom CSS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/my-custom-css/)
* [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me) comes with a [custom CSS module](http://jetpack.me/support/custom-css/)


= What is my image URL? =

Your image must first be uploaded to your blog or a picture hosting service like [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com). Find the direct link to the image (you will see a `.jpg`, `.gif` or `.png` at the end of the URL).

= My image is sticking out past my sidebar =

Add the following CSS to your theme.

	.click-grab-box-button img {
		max-width: 100%;
		height: auto;
	} 

= How can I center the image =

Add the following CSS to your theme.
